            <h2>Is [insert game] compatible with Lime3DS?</h2>
            <p>You can view Lime3DS's game compatibility by visiting our <a href="https://lime3ds.github.io/pages/compatibility/">compatibility tracker</a>.</p>

            <h2>Why does nothing happen when I open Lime3DS?</h2>
            <p>There are 2 executables that come with Lime3DS named 'lime3ds', and 'lime3ds-room'.</p>
            <p>Please ensure you are opening the program named 'lime3ds'.</p>
            <br/>

            <h2>What does the error 'MSVCP140_ATOMIC_WAIT.dll not found' mean?</h2>
            <p>If this error appears while using the Windows MSVC version of Lime3DS, it means that you have not installed the required Visual C++ Redistributable package.</p>
            <p>You can download this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170">here</a>. The issue should disappear after it is installed.</p>

            <h2>Will Lime3DS ever have support for iOS?</h2>
            <p>Support for iOS is not planned for the foreseeable future. It is instead recommended that you use an iOS build of the original Citra emulator.</p>
